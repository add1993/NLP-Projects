For part 4 and 6,
the following new functions have been created in order to separate it from mixing with the previous definitions of the functions.

The functions for part 4 are as follows : 
get_features_dal (preprocessed_snippet, dal)
The function calls the get_features(preprocessed_snippet) function to return the numpy array. It then further calls the score_snippet (preprocessed_snippet, dal) function to return the scores.
score_snippet() function is specifically to handle the part 4 case.

For part 6 case, I have created score_snippet_modified as the new function. The detailed explanation is below

The functions for part 6 are the same as part 4
get_features_dal(preprocessed_snippet, dal) calls get_features(preprocessed_snippet) function to return the numpy array and then further we call the score_snippet_modified(preprocessed_snippet, dal) function. The score_snippet_modified() function will handle the case of looking into the synonym and antonym of the word if not present in dal dictionary.

Therefore, in order to prevent confusion. I have created separate methods to part 4 and 6 for easy testing.

By default the code runs the score_snippet_modified() code which is the code for part 6.
